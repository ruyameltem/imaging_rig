<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Developed by</strong> Edwards lab, University of Reading School of Pharmacy <a href="https://research.reading.ac.uk/biomedical-technology-lab/">Biomedical Technology Lab</a></p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The imaging rig has been developing to quickly test platelet function for cardiovascular health and disease epidemiology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This system can be used to measure the parameters of liquids such as density and viscosity. By taking time-lapse images, kinetic information of the fluid in the capillary can be obtained. In this way, it is a suitable device not only for blood studies, but also for anyone who wants to work with fluids.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This project aims to develop new assays and miniaturised devices to measure the function of the blood cells involved in clotting and thrombus formation- platelets (thrombocytes). The micro capillary film containing small capillaries and made using a melt extrusion process is used to develop new ways of measuring platelet function. We have been testing new detection methods such as using the Raspberry Pi camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This research shall contribute to the improvement of a new generation with state-of-the-art but affordable point-of-care tests for global utilizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The device is shown below.</p>
